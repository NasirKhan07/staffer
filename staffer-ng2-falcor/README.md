# staffer-ng2-falcor

To run this application, first make sure that both staffer-server-rest and staffer-server-falcor are running.

Then run the following commands in this directory:

```bash
$ npm install -g angular-cli  (if you have not installed angular-cli globally)
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```

Now point your browser to http://localhost:4200/.

Note: This version of Staffer is under construction. Currently it only fetches the needs from the Falcor server. All other entities are fetched from the REST server.
