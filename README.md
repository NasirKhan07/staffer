# Staffer

The goal of this project is to demonstrate key concepts behind [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) and [Falcor](http://netflix.github.io/falcor/).

Below is a description of the sub-projects.

## Servers
1. staffer-server-rest: This server exposes a RESTful API for the staffer application. You are required to run it for all versions of the client application.

2. staffer-server-concepts: This server is used for explaining graph data concepts. Currently, you are required to run it for the Falcor version of the client (in addition to running the RESTful server).

## Clients
1. staffer-ng2-basic: A very basic version of the client using Angular 2 only.

2. staffer-ng2-redux: A more advanced version of the client using Angular 2 + Redux (ng2-redux).

3. staffer-ng2-falcor: A more advanced version of the client using Angular 2 + Falcor (under construction).
